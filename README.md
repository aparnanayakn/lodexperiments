# LOD Cloud Experiments

In this repository we provide a Jupyter notebook with a number of experiments that can be performed to understand better the metadata of the datasets visualised in the LOD cloud. 

These experiments and their results are described in our paper: Debattista et al. - Is the LOD cloud at risk of becoming a museum for datasets? Looking ahead towards a fully collaborative and sustainable LOD cloud.
